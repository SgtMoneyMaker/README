During the creation of Rosen Clicker we faced a few challenges. Our original vision for the project was to include an upgrade button, which gave the player things like multipliers and auto clickers. Unfortunately due to the fact that our project was made primarily with turtles, we found this especially difficult and had to scrap the idea. What we did instead was what you see in the final product, every 20 clicks the player is able to unlock a new version of Professor Rosen and it also plays a sound whenever a new Rosen is unlocked. We tried a few ideas during the brainstorming process of the project researching different ways cookie clickers were made. We attempted to create the Rosen Clicker with pygame but due to our coding inexperience we stuck with what we already knew which was turtles. I feel like the adversities we faced when making this project actually worked in our favor because with the upgrade button not working, we(Vincent) were able to create some hilarious variations of Rosen and we hope you find them amusing too.
